<p>-Start by betting low and increasing your bet as you go. This will help ensure that you don’t lose too much money if you happen to lose early in the game.</p>
<p>-Make sure you keep track of what cards have been played. This will help you make better decisions about when to bet and when to hold off.</p>
<p>-Always remember that it’s better to stay under 21 than risk going over and losing everything. Even if you have a good hand, it might be worth folding if the odds aren’t in your favour.</p>
<p>Now that you’re armed with these tips, it’s time to hit the casino floor and see how much fun Bons can be!</p>

One of the latest trends is party roulette, which is a variation of the classic game that involves betting on which teammate will have to do a dare.</p>
<p>Here’s how to play: split into two teams and give each team a bottle. Place a number of small objects (coins, candy, etc.) inside the bottle. Each team takes turns spinning their bottle. Whoever the bottle points to must do whatever dare is written on one of the objects inside the bottle. If there are no more objects left in the bottle, then that player must choose a teammate to do a dare instead. The first team to complete all its dares wins!</p>
<p>Party roulette is great for getting everyone excited and engaged in the game. It can also be modified to be as naughty or as tame as you want it to be. So gather your friends and give party roulette a try – it’s guaranteed to be a night you won’t forget!</p>

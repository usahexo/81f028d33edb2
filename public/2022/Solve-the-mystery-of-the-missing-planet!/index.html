        <h1 id="Solve-the-mystery-of-the-missing-planet"><a href="#Solve-the-mystery-of-the-missing-planet" class="headerlink" title="Solve the mystery of the missing planet!"></a>Solve the mystery of the missing planet!</h1><p>As astronomers continue to make new discoveries about the universe, one mystery looms ever larger: what happened to the missing planet?</p>
<p>The problem began to be noticed in the late 1800s, when calculations showed that there should be a planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. However, when telescopes were aimed in that direction, no sign of the planet could be found. This discrepancy became known as the “missing planet” problem.</p>
<p>Over time, various theories were put forth to try and explain the missing planet’s disappearance. One theory was that it had been destroyed by a comet or asteroid. Another theory was that it had simply never existed in the first place, and that the calculations had been incorrect.</p>
<p>However, in 1930, an astronomer named Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto, which seemed to solve the mystery of the missing planet. But then, in 2006, Pluto was demoted from a planet to a “dwarf planet”, leading to renewed speculation about what had happened to the original ninth planet.</p>
<p>As of yet, there is no definitive answer to this question. However, astronomers continue to search for clues, and new theories are being proposed all the time. So far, though, none of them have been able to completely solve the mystery of the missing planet.</p>
<h1 id="Can-you-help-save-the-planet"><a href="#Can-you-help-save-the-planet" class="headerlink" title="Can you help save the planet?"></a>Can you help save the planet?</h1><p>The choices we make every day have a direct impact on the planet. From the food we eat to the way we get around, each decision has an ecological cost.</p>
<p>But there are ways we can all make small changes that add up to a big difference. If you’re looking for ways to help save the planet, here are five ideas to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eat less meat</li>
</ol>
<p>According to some estimates, producing beef requires 28 times more land and 11 times more water than producing pork or chicken. What’s more, cows produce large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for ways to help save the planet, eating less meat is a good place to start. You can still enjoy meaty meals occasionally, but try incorporating more plant-based foods into your diet and see how you feel.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use public transportation</li>
</ol>
<p> cars account for almost one-fifth of global CO2 emissions. By using public transportation or car-sharing services instead of driving yourself, you can significantly reduce your ecological footprint. What’s more, using public transportation is often faster and cheaper than driving yourself.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Unplug electronics when not in use</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people leave their electronics plugged in when they’re not using them, which wastes energy and contributes to climate change. So unplug your devices when you’re not using them and save some energy (and money on your electricity bill).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Recycle and compost</li>
</ol>
<p>Many products we use every day can be recycled or composted instead of thrown away. So make sure you recycle paper, plastic, metal and glass products, and compost organic materials like food scraps and lawn clippings. This will help reduce the amount of waste going into landfills and improve the health of our planet.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Invest in renewable energy</li>
</ol>

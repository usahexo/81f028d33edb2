#  Former Gambler Turns to Crime to Pay Off Debts

For many people, gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time. But for some, gambling can become a problem, leading to financial difficulties and even debt. When faced with mounting bills and no way to pay them, some gamblers turn to crime to make ends meet.

One man from Missouri found himself in this predicament. He had been gambling heavily for years, and eventually accrued over $100,000 in debts. Desperate to find a way to pay off his debts, he began robbing convenience stores and other small businesses. He was eventually caught and sentenced to prison.

While this may be an extreme case, it is not unusual for gambling addiction to lead to criminal activity. In fact, a study by the University of Cambridge found that 25 percent of pathological gamblers have committed a crime in order to finance their addiction.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling and support groups. Addiction can be a difficult habit to break, but with help it is possible to overcome it and live a healthy and productive life.

#  Woman Swindled Out of Life Savings in Gambling Debt Scheme

A woman in her early twenties has fallen victim to a gambling debt scheme, losing her life savings in the process. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says she was approached by a man at a casino who offered her a seemingly too-good-to-be-true deal. He told her that he could help her win back the money she had lost at the casino, but only if she handed over her life savings up front as collateral. naively, the woman agreed, and gave him everything she had. The next time she saw the man, he was nowhere to be found. She has since been left with nothing but thousands of dollars in debt.

Sadly, this woman is not alone in falling victim to gambling debt schemes. In fact, these types of scams are on the rise across the country as con artists take advantage of desperate people looking for a quick fix. The best way to avoid being scammed is to be aware of the warning signs:

1) Be suspicious of anyone offering you a "guaranteed" win or debt relief solution – if it seems too good to be true, it probably is!

2) Do your research! Check with local authorities or consumer protection organizations to see if any complaints have been filed against the company or individual you're considering doing business with.

3) Don't be afraid to ask questions! If something doesn't seem right, ask for clarification. Legitimate businesses will be happy to answer your questions.

4) Never hand over your money or personal information without first doing your own due diligence. Take the time to research any potential lenders or investment opportunities before signing on the dotted line.

5) If you think you may have been scammed, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are many organizations available that can offer advice and support – don't suffer in silence!

#  $1 million in Gambling Debts leads to Bankruptcy


According to a recent study, nearly 1 in 4 people who file for bankruptcy do so because of unmanageable gambling debts. This amounts to more than $1 million in bankruptcy claims each year.

The study, conducted by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, also found that more than half of all bankruptcy filers have gambling problems. In comparison, only 27 percent of bankruptcy filers have credit card debt and 22 percent have mortgage debt.

“Gambling addiction can quickly lead to financial ruin,” said Gail Cunningham, spokesperson for the NFCC. “In many cases, the addiction causes individuals to lose their jobs, homes and vehicles. When creditors come calling, bankruptcy often seems like the only way out.”

Bankruptcy can offer some relief from crushing gambling debts, but it is not a cure-all. Gamblers who file for bankruptcy still face significant financial challenges in the future. They may be able to keep their home and car, but they will likely lose other assets and may have trouble getting new credit.

If you are struggling with gambling debts, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for those who need assistance dealing with an addiction, including counseling and support groups.

He also owes money to friends and family members. The total amount of his debt is unknown, but it is estimated to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. 

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. In this case, the man's wife and children are struggling as well. His wife fears for her family's safety if the man doesn't find a way to pay off his debts soon.

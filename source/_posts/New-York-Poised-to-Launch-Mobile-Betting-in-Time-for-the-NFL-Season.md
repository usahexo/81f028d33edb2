#  New York Officials Finalize Mobile Sports Betting Regulations

After months of review and debate, the New York State Gaming Commission has released the finalized regulations for mobile sports betting in the state. The regulations are largely in line with what was initially proposed, with a few key changes.

First and foremost, the minimum age to place a mobile sports bet will be 21, as opposed to 18 as initially proposed. This is in line with the age requirement for casino gambling in New York. In addition, there will be a $10 limit on individual bets.

The regulations also stipulate that players must reside in New York in order to place a wager. This is intended to prevent out-of-state residents from taking advantage of New York’s legal sports betting market.

Finally, wagers will only be allowed on games that take place within New York state borders. This ensures that the state’s gaming commission receives its fair share of revenue from sports betting activity.

These regulations are set to go into effect on August 1, 2019. Until then, it is still illegal to place a mobile sports bet in New York state. But once the regulations do take effect, interested players will be able to place wagers through licensed operators such as FanDuel and DraftKings.

#  New Yorkers to Start Placing Bets on their Phones at the End of the Month

This past week, the New York State Gaming Commission announced that starting at the end of the month, New Yorkers will be able to place bets on their phones. The commission said that the app would be available for download from the Apple App Store and the Google Play store.

While betting is currently only allowed on horse races, the new app will allow people to bet on a variety of sporting events, including baseball, basketball, and football. In addition, people will also be able to bet on other events such as the outcomes of elections and whether or not certain celebrities will get married or have children.

The commission has been working on the app for over a year and has been working with a number of gaming companies in order to make sure that the app is ready for launch. One company, IGT, has already created a version of its popular Megabucks slot machine game that will be available on the app.

When asked about why they were launching the app now, a spokesperson for the commission said that they wanted to give New Yorkers as much time as possible to get used to it before the start of the baseball season. “We want people to have plenty of time to learn how to use it and make sure that they are comfortable with it before they start betting on their favorite teams,” she said.

The commission also said that it hoped that the app would help generate more revenue for the state government. In addition to allowing people to bet on sporting events, the app will also allow people to place bets on casino games such as blackjack and roulette.

#  New York Set to Benefit from $120 Million in Annual Mobile Betting Revenue

With the recent news that New York is set to legalize mobile sports betting, the state is expecting to see an influx of over $120 million in annual revenue. This number is expected to grow in coming years as the industry continues to expand.

The new law, which was signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday, allows for both online and in-person betting. It will go into effect 30 days after it is signed, which means that it will be operational in time for this year’s NFL season.

This is great news for the state, which has been struggling with budget deficits in recent years. The new law is expected to generate around $300 million in tax revenue over the next five years.

Not only will this provide much-needed revenue for New York, but it will also create jobs and bring economic development to certain areas of the state. In particular, casino operators are expected to benefit from the increased traffic generated by legalized mobile betting.

So far, Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey have already legalized mobile sports betting. Other states are expected to follow suit in the near future, as the industry continues to grow at a rapid pace.

#  Sports Betting Finally Comes to New York as Mobile Apps Launch

The wait is finally over for New Yorkers who want to bet on sports. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday that mobile apps from DraftKings and FanDuel are now live in the state. Bettors can download the apps and start placing bets on Tuesday, September 18.

“This is about consumer choice and creating a new industry in New York,” said Governor Cuomo. “We are authorizing and regulating this new activity which will bring jobs and tax revenue to our state while ensuring that it occurs in a safe and responsible manner.”

Cuomo signed a bill into law in July that authorized sports betting in the state. The law allows both DraftKings and FanDuel to offer their mobile apps, as well as other sports betting operators who have obtained a license from the New York Gaming Commission.

Sports betting is now legal in a total of 11 states, including Nevada, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Mississippi, New Jersey, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kentucky.

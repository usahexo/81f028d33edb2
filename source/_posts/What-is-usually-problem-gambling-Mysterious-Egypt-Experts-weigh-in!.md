#  What is usually problem gambling Mysterious Egypt? Experts weigh in!

With a population of over 91 million, it's not surprising that all sorts of problems can arise in Egypt. One such problem that has caught the attention of experts and the media in recent years is problem gambling. So what is usually problem gambling Mysterious Egypt? And how do experts weigh in on the matter?

Problem gambling is loosely defined as a situation where someone gambles compulsively and to the point where it has negative consequences on their life. This can include problems with family, finances, work, or studies. Gamblers can become so absorbed in their addiction that they ignore important responsibilities and even lose touch with reality.

There is no one answer to the question of what causes people to develop a problem with gambling. Some experts say it could be due to genetic factors, while others believe that environmental or social influences are more likely to blame. It's worth noting that in countries like Egypt, which have a strong casino culture, the line between social and problematic gambling can often be blurred.

So what does this mean for Egyptians? Well, unfortunately there isn't much research available on the topic specific to Egypt. However, we can look at what international experts have had to say about problem gambling in general.

One study by the Harvard Medical School found that problem gamblers are up to six times more likely to commit suicide than those who don't gamble compulsively. Other research suggests that problem gamblers are also more likely to suffer from mental health issues like depression and anxiety. There is also evidence to suggest that people who gamble excessively are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol.

All of this paints a pretty bleak picture for those affected by problem gambling. However, there is hope! Egyptian experts working in this field are beginning to open up about the issue and start initiatives to help those affected. There are also groups like Gamcare and Gambling Therapy which offer support and advice for those struggling with a gambling addiction.

In the area of Gulf of al-Suez, a few kilometers from the city of Ismailia, there is an area called el-Bad did not receive much attention from either archaeologists or scholars. However, in this place there lies a mystery that is still waiting to be unraveled. It is a site known as el-Bad Lake.

The locals call it “Bahr Jarrad”, which means “the lake of skulls”. The first European to visit the place was Sir Richard Burton in 1854 who was quite shocked by what he saw there. He described skulls piled up next to the water like some macabre shrine. Many theories have been put forward to explain the strange appearance of this place but no one has been able to provide a definitive answer.

The skulls could have belonged to ancient Egyptians who were killed during one of the many wars fought in this region or they could have been victims of an epidemic. Some researchers believe that they may have been sacrificed by the ancient people of the region as part of some dark ritual. There are even those who suggest that these skulls may have belonged to aliens!

Whatever their origins may be, these skulls continue to fascinate and unnerve those who see them. They offer a glimpse into a mysterious past that is still waiting to be explored.

Problem gambling is currently classified as an impulse control disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This means that it is a condition in which a person has trouble resisting the temptation to gamble, even though it may have negative consequences for themselves and their loved ones. Problem gambling can take many different forms, but typically refers to activities such as betting on sports, playing poker, or gambling in casinos.

The causes of problem gambling are not yet fully understood, but it is thought that a variety of factors may be involved. These may include genetic predisposition, personality traits such as impulsiveness or sensation-seeking, early exposure to gambling, and stress or anxiety. Some people may also be more likely to develop a problem gambling addiction if they live in a society where gambling is readily available and socially acceptable.

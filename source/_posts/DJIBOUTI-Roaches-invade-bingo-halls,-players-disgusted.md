#  DJIBOUTI: Roaches invade bingo halls, players disgusted

DJIBOUTI CITY, DJIBOUTI - The national bingo halls association has called for an emergency meeting to address the roach invasion that has made its way into bingo halls across the country.

The pests have been scurrying around the hallways and on the playing tables, much to the disgust of players.

"It's just gross," said one player. "They're all over the place."

Officials at the National Bingo Halls Association say they are not sure how the roaches got into the buildings, but they are working closely with local authorities to address the issue.

In the meantime, players are being advised to keep their eyes peeled for roaches and to avoid touching them if possible.

#  Bingo halls close in DJIBOUTI as roaches take over

Residents in the Djiboutian capital are up in arms over the closure of all the city's bingo halls, as cockroaches have taken over the premises.

The tiny nation located on the Horn of Africa is a popular destination for tourists, drawn by its dramatic landscape and history. However, observers say that the closure of the bingo halls is another blow to the city's tourism industry, which is already struggling to compete with neighbouring countries.

"It's been a nightmare," said Fathia Mohamed, who owns a small restaurant near one of the now-closed bingo halls. "The cockroaches were everywhere and it was impossible to keep them out of my restaurant."

City officials say that they have tried to address the problem, but that the cockroaches are simply too widespread and too difficult to get rid of. They have also warned residents not to eat food from street vendors, as there is a high risk of being infected with salmonella.

"We are doing everything we can to make sure that people are safe," said Abdourahman Mohamed, a spokesperson for the city government. "But at this point, we just don't know what to do."

#  DJIBOUTI: Bingo cancelled after roach invasion

Hundreds of people were left disappointed after a bingo game in Djibouti was cancelled because of a roach invasion.

The insects were spotted scurrying around the hall where the game was due to take place, and organisers decided it was not safe to go ahead.

“We did not want to take any risks and so we called off the game,” said one of the organisers.

It is not clear how the roaches managed to get into the building, but officials say they are now working to get rid of them.

#  Roaches run wild during bingo game in DJIBOUTI

Residents of Djibouti were in for quite a surprise this week when, instead of the bingo game they were expecting, a horde of cockroaches descended on the hall where the event was to take place.

Wild roaches could be seen running everywhere as people scrambled to get away from them. Some brave souls even tried to capture the insects on camera, but it was difficult to keep them in focus as they zigzagged through the air.

"It was just awful," said one eyewitness. "The roaches were everywhere. They were climbing up the walls, crawling over people's heads."

According to local officials, the roaches likely came into the building through an open door or window. They are still trying to determine how best to deal with the infestation.

In the meantime, residents are advised to avoid all contact with cockroaches, which can carry diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery.

#  Bingo players flee as roaches overrun table in DJIBOUTI

Bingo players were in for a shock when they were interrupted by a swarm of cockroaches at their table in Djibouti.

Some players fled the scene in disgust, while others attempted to kill the insects with whatever they had at hand.

The roaches appeared to have come from a hole in the wall near the bingo board.

"It was disgusting," said one player. "I've never seen anything like it before."

Officials are now investigating how the cockroaches managed to get into the hall in the first place.

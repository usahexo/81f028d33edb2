#  How many different Slotfather 2 games are there?

Slotfather 2 is a five-reel slot game with thirty pay lines. The game has a wide range of betting options, from $0.01 to $100 per spin. There are four different bonus rounds in the game, as well as a progressive jackpot.

There are also three different variations of Slotfather 2. These are Slotfather 2: The Revenge, Slotfather 2: Gold Edition, and Slotfather 2: Christmas Edition.

The Revenge is a similar game to the original Slotfather 2, but it has a new set of graphics and sound effects. Gold Edition has higher payouts than the original game, and Christmas Edition features a festive theme with snowflakes and presents.

#  Are the Slotfather 2 avatars gender specific?

Slotfather 2 avatars are gender specific, with male and female versions available. This is different from the original Slotfather game, which did not have specific avatars.

Some people feel that the gender specificity of the avatars limits player choice, while others appreciate that there is a clear distinction between the male and female characters. No matter what side of the debate you fall on, it is important to be aware of the difference before you start playing.

The male avatar is typically dressed in a black suit and has a cigar in his mouth, while the female avatar is wearing a revealing red dress and has long hair. Both avatars have a Mafia-style cap on their head.

Some people think that the masculine appearance of the male avatar sends a negative message about women, but this has not been confirmed by any real data. In fact, some studies suggest that players are more likely to engage with games that have gender-specific avatars.

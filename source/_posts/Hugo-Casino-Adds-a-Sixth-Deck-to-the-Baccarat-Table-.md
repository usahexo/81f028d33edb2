#  Aces are Wild in Hugo's Baccarat - Now with Six Decks!

In Hugo's baccarat, aces are wild! This means that they can count as any other card to make up a hand. With six decks in play, there are more opportunities for a natural (a baccarat hand with two cards totaling nine points or higher).

Players can still bet on the banker or player hands, and the same rules apply. The only difference is that with six decks in play, the odds of getting a natural are slightly better. So be sure to place your bets and see who comes out on top in Hugo's baccarat!

#  Hugo Casino Doubles Down on Baccarat with 12 Decks

Hugo Casino is doubling down on their baccarat offerings by using 12 decks in their games. The casino believes that this will give players the best possible chance to win big.

Hugo Casino is one of the most popular online casinos in the world. They offer a wide variety of games, including baccarat, blackjack, roulette, and slots. Now, they’re taking things up a notch by using 12 decks in their baccarat games.

Baccarat is a popular game for high rollers. It’s a simple game to learn, but there is some strategy involved. The object of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible. The player and banker are both dealt two cards, and the highest total wins. If both cards are the same value, the third card is drawn to determine the winner.

There are three ways to bet in baccarat – player, banker, and tie. The player bet gives you the best odds, but also has the lowest potential payout. The banker bet has slightly worse odds, but has a higher potential payout. The tie bet has the worst odds of all, but also has the highest potential payout.

Most casinos use 8 decks in their baccarat games. By using 12 decks, Hugo Casino is giving players even better odds of winning. This makes it a great option for high rollers who want to make some serious money.

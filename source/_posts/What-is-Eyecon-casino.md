There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to reach out to a public figure or company depends on the specific situation. However, here are some tips on how to find an address for a public figure or company.

For a public figure, try searching for their website or social media profile. Many times, you will be able to find an email or postal address on these pages. If you can't find an address on the official website, try searching for news articles or blog posts about the individual – often times, other journalists will have published the individual's contact information.

For a company, start by looking for their website. Almost all companies have an "About" page with contact information listed.

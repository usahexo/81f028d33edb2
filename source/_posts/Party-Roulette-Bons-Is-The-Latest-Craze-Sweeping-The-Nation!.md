#  How To Play Party Roulette Bons - The Fun New Way To Spin The Bottle!

Ever since the game of spin the bottle was created, people have been finding new and exciting ways to make it more fun. One of the latest trends is party roulette, which is a variation of the classic game that involves betting on which teammate will have to do a dare.

Here's how to play: split into two teams and give each team a bottle. Place a number of small objects (coins, candy, etc.) inside the bottle. Each team takes turns spinning their bottle. Whoever the bottle points to must do whatever dare is written on one of the objects inside the bottle. If there are no more objects left in the bottle, then that player must choose a teammate to do a dare instead. The first team to complete all its dares wins!

Party roulette is great for getting everyone excited and engaged in the game. It can also be modified to be as naughty or as tame as you want it to be. So gather your friends and give party roulette a try – it’s guaranteed to be a night you won’t forget!

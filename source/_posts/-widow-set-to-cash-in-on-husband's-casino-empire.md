#   widow set to cash in on husband's casino empire

The widow of a casino magnate is set to inherit his £2.5bn empire, it has been reported.

Gina Rinehart, the 61-year-old stepmother of John Hancock, who died suddenly last week aged 54, is thought to be the sole beneficiary of his business interests.

Hancock was the son of Australian mining tycoon Lang Hancock and his fourth wife, Rose Porteous.

He made his fortune in the casino and hotel industry and was believed to be one of Britain's richest men.

Rinehart is said to have been left with a £1.5bn stake in the company, as well as other assets and property.

A spokesman for Rinehart declined to comment on the reports.

Wife Stands to Make Millions From Husband's Casino Empire

The wife of a casino magnate is in line to make millions after her husband's company agreed a $1.1billion takeover.

According to reports, the wife of Sheldon Adelson - CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp - will gain control of $811million worth of stock options as well as another $300million in dividends.

The news comes as the company agreed a takeover by Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment Group.

The move gives the Adelson family a windfall just weeks after Republicans suffered a major defeat in the US midterm elections, with many attributing Mr Adelson's huge spending on behalf of the party as a factor in their loss.
